# 1. Introduction
## 1.2 Challenges
The four key dimensions to the question "Why is Software so Difficult to Get Right?" are:
- *Complexity*: Modern software systems are huge, they are created by many developers over several years. They also have a high number of discrete states and execution paths.
- *Change*: Software systems often deviate from their initial design. Typical changes include: New features, new interfaces, bug fixing, performance tuning.
- *Competing Objectives*: Functionality vs usability, cost vs robustness, performance vs portability, etc.
- *Constraints*: Such as budget, time, staff and their available skills.


## 1.4 Solution Approaches
This course is split up into four parts:
- Part I, Writing clean code: Modularity, Coupling, Design Patterns
- Part II, Software Testing: Metrics, exhaustive, random, functional, structural testing.
- Part III, Software Analysis at Scale: Math, heap, numerical, symbolic execution, concolic execution, fuzzing
- Part IV, Modeling: Model finding, Alloy, applications to memory models
